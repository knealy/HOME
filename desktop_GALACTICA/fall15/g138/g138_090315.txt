The geological timescale:
------------------------------
Eons:

Hadean = 'hidden eon' (4.55 to 2.5 Bya)
	-Precambrian period

Archean = Oldest fossils, microscopic life. Visible fossils rare. (3850 to 2500 mya)
	-Precambrian period

Proterozoic = (2700 to 542 bya)
	-Precambrian period 

Paleozoic = (570 to 245 mya)
	- Cambrian (542 to 488 mya)
	- Ordovician 
	- Silurian
	- Devonian
	- Carboniferous
		-- Mississippian
		-- Pennsylvanian
	- Permian

Mesozoic = (245 to 65 mya)
	- Triassic
	- Jurassic
	- Cretaceous

Cenozoic = Rise of mammals (past 65 mya)
	- Palogene
	- Neogene
	- Quarternary

Correlation of rock layers across:
Grand canyon, zion, Bryce canyon
..
Large amount of geological history can be observed through comparing the strata of several geologic sites.

Radiometric methods: specify the number of years based on compositional decay of heavy elements by properties of physics.

Other calibrated methods: dendrochronology (tree rings), varve chronology(lake sediment), 
and other observations that rely on annual cyclicity.
