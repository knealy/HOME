How uniform are the rates and direction of transform motion for the Pacific plate along the San Andreas fault? Are the rates and direction of transform motion of the Pacific plate in these two locations (N. California & S. California) similar to the rates and direction of seafloor spreading determined in Part A of this exercise for the Gulf of California?

1.)
The rates and direction of transform motion for the Pacific plate along the San Andreas fault are very uniform. The rates and direction of the plate observed at the two different points (N. California and S. California) are much more uniform than the two recorded directions and rates observed along the spreading ridge near the Gulf of California. The relative velocity between the North American and Pacific plates at (37.00, 238.00) is 48.25 mm/year with azimuth N325.5E and 47.20 mm/year with azimuth N321.2E at (34.00, 242.00). That is less than two mm/year variation in rate of movement, and less than 5 degrees of variation in the direction of movement. Far less than the rates observed for the spreading ridges.

2.)

The present distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco is about 480 km. When (approximately) in the future (millions of years) will Los Angeles become a suburb of San Francisco (and vice versa)?

There are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 1000 millimeters in a meter. Thus, 480 km is equivalent to 480,000 meters, and 480,000,000 millimeters. Since the Pacific plate is moving at am average of 47.5 mm/year along the San Andreas fault line, the answer is 480,000,000 divided by 47.5. In roughly 10 million years, Los Angeles will become a suburb of San Francisco.
