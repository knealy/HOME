For project 7, I implemented a breadth first search algorithm within the find_paths function to traverse the nodes of a given grid, finding paths unblocked by obstacles and unused to the given destination. At each node, representing nodes on a computer chip, the function searches the adjacent coordinates for unobstructed nodes. If any are found, the adjacent node is added to the queue, and so on. Paths can be retraced by traversing the parents of nodes in reverse from the end point back to the start. Once a number of paths are found, the shortest distance "wire" is added to the grid, and all the coordinates along the wire are changed to obstacles (value of -1). The whole process is then repeated beginning on the next start node, with the newly added wire forming another obstacle to be avoided.

I spent roughly 25 hours altogether.
