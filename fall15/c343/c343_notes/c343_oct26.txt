Binomial Heaps:
- Binomial trees
- Binomial forests
- Link 2 trees 
- Insert tree into forest
- Merge two forests


C(n k) n choose k 
# ways to choose k elements from a set of size n
{a,b,c} 

C(n k) = n!/k!(n-k)!

# ways to choose 2
 C(3 2) = 3

 {a,b}, {b,c}, {a,c}

# Number of nodes at depth k in B(n) (binomial tree) is C(n k)
# To construct a Bn (Binomial Tree), take 2 copies of Bn-1, make one the child of the other's root.



Def: A binomial forest is a collection of binomial trees

Def: A binomial heap is a Binomial forest where each tree has a unique size, add a key to every node, maintain max-heap property.
