Implementation of a Huffman coding tree using a Priority Queue built
with a minimum heap binary tree. The code uses a minimum heap priority queue
to build up a Huffman tree from give characters and their frequenceies, 
and retraces the steps necessary to reach a given element starting from the root.
Zero's repesent traversing the left branch, while 1's represent the right. 

I spent approximately 20 hours coding and debugging for this project.
