Project 6

For this project, I implemented a hashtable (list of lists of items) to use for the code from project 5.
The hashtable basically treats entries as dictionary items with key:value pair,
and uses chaining to resolve collisions. 
The size of the hashtable also doubles as the table gets full to keep elements well distributed. 


Hours:
I spent roughly 7 hours coding/debugging this project.
