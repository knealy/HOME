Lecture 9/17:

The rock cycle: processes by which rocks break down into sediment, and come together again to make new rocks out of old sediment. 

Metamorphic rock:
	-formed by the alteration of other rocks at high temp/pressure.
Metamorphism
	-causes chemical and textural changes in igneous, sedimentary, and other metamorphic rocks.

Every metamorphic rock has a parent rock from which it formed.


Parent rock: randomly orientated mineral grain.
Metamorphic: deformed tightly banded sedimentary layers.

Quartz sandstone =(tmp+pr)=> Quartzite 

Temperature and pressure increase with depth into the earths crust.

Metamorphic	 vs 	sedimentary 	vs 	igneous

Foliated: texture gets more banded as we move up

schist - medium to high grade metamorphic rocks.

Gneiss - high-grade metamorphic rock.
	- foliated texture

Non-foliated:
	Quartzite - formed from quartz rich sandstone.
		  - grains fuzed
	Marble - crystalline rock from limestone or dolostone parent.
		- main mineral is calcite.

Burial metamorphism: 
	occurs in sedimentary basins under the high pressure of accumulating layers.
	
Regional metamorphism: 
	associated with the deformation of Earhts lithosphere under compressional and extensional stresses conditions.

Contact metamorphism: 
	occurs where hot granitic magma rises through preexisting rock (country rock) and releases heat to the rocks.

Hydrothermal metamorphism: 
	occurs where hot waters pass through cracks in rocks and may associated with other areas where metamorphism of rock occurs.
